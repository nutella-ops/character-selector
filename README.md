# Character Selector

*Short Story:* I wanted to remove arbitrary characters from strings.

*Long Story:* I haven't figured out how to quickly and accurately select arbitrary sections of similar strings. Regex is my main choice for this type of problem, but I never get exacly what I want. I have been intending to learn Perl a long time and the language was designed for text manipulation, so this seemed like a good time to learn Perl and see if better results can be had.
